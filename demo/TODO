1.  Take border radius in consideration when calculating the boundaries of 
    the overlay boxes (is this even possible with this overlay approach?)

2.  What if target is document or window object? (current code will break)

3.  Option to add arbitrary padding to target area

4.  Think of new name for plugin (?)

5.  Add shadow effect on target for pure awesomeness

6.  Apply decent pattern to code to hide private stuff
